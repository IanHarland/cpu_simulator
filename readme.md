# CPU SIMULATOR

This project was part of the CodeCademy CS course for the Computer Architecture section.
Essentially, the program models what a CPU would do on a very simple level:
* Model memory with a Memory class
* Model cache witha a Cache class
* Model and adder circuit using python-built gates
* Create registers and functions that act as the CPU

There should be 5 files:
1. main.py This is where the code and tests are executed
2. adder.py for the adder circuit
3. cache.py for the cache Class and its methods
4. gates.py to model the gates (all based on NAND)
5. memory.py for the Memory class and methods
